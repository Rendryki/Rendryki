# **Hi, guys!** 👋🏽

## About me: 
I'm a 19 years old development student. I'm at the beggining of my journey into turning myself a developer, recently I've been focusing on learning the fundaments of web development as a point of start in my academic/professional carreer. 

Some topics about me:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5/CSS3!
- 💻 I'm also learning JavaScript and Python!
- 📚 I'm open to learn something new everyday!
- 🏆 I'm a sports lover!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the only 'Rendryki' with that exact calligraphy in Brazil, and probably the World.
